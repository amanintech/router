In this guide, we will use React-ga that handles the Google Analytics tag and sends that data whenever there is a URL change by listening to the route changes.

## Step 1: Setup Google Analytics Property
We will first create a Google Analytics property and obtain the tracking ID

## Step 2: Install React GA
React GA is a JavaScript module that can be used to include Google Analytics tracking code in a website or app that uses React for its front-end codebase.
Installation using npm:  
`npm install react-ga --save`
## Step 3: Import required modules
Now we would need to import the following modules from the Reach Router and the react-ga library in our App.js   
```
import { Router,createHistory,LocationProvider }from "@reach/router";   
import ReactGA from "react-ga";
```
## Step 4: Setup tracking Code
Initialize Google Analytics with the obtained tracking ID in the first step in the global scope just after the export in App.js . Also, declare const history globally that enables you to record the browser history. We will use the constant later.
```
ReactGA.initialize("UA-103xxxxx-xx"); 
const history= createHistory(window);
```
## Step 5: Handle the Routes

Now declare <LocationProvider history={history}> in return statement of your const App ifi function in App.js so that all components are inside it. This will help us listen to the URLâ€™s as the route changes.
## Step 6: Send the Tracking Data
Now on every URL change using history.listen, we will trigger and send the data using ReactGA.pageview. For this, we will setup a function that listen to the history object and changes the value of ReactGA.pageview object inside the const APP ifi function in our app.js
```
history.listen( window => {
  ReactGA.pageview(window.location.pathname+ window.location.search);
  console.log('page=>',window.location.pathname);
}); 
```
Here `window.location.pathname` is the URL and window.location.search are the URL Params.
Your dinal setup in App.js should look something like this

Run your code and you should be able to see the changes live in google analytics dashboard as you change the path.
## Bonus Step: Sending Aditional Info

You can also send additional information using React.GA such as user ID, demographic, preference and other additional information and even on certain triggers using the same approach.
